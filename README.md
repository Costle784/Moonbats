# Moonbats!

Pick your favorite team, pick a game on their schedule, then let Moonbats tell you who will win based on the phase of the moon. 
Moonbats takes the moonphase on the day of the desired game prediction then iterates over the teams' history playing against one another. It
then filters through that to match the moonphase of the desired game and calculates your teams winning percentage.

Technologies include Rails, Postgresql, React, Axios
